# Vue Todolist

This is the vue frontend for the backend todolist api that I created.

You can get the backend code from [here](https://github.com/kellyjoe256/node-todolist-app).

## Getting it to work

### Backend

* Download the backend code files from the link above and then run `npm install` but make sure you have MongoDB installed(For more on that checkout [this](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/) out).

* Run `node index.js`

### Frontend
* Run `npm install`
* Then `npm run serve`
